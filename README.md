# Django Girls

This repository exists to help set up the necessary requirements for the DjangoGirls tutorial.

This will only install the Python (and Django) related portion of the tutorial.

To get code editing set up you'll need to install an appropriate code editor, there's details of this in the tutorial.

If you needed to get something set up you may wish to try VSCode as it will work on all the various operating systems you may have (Windows/Linux/Mac):

## Using Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) tool that will help automate the install steps to get everything in ready to do the tutorial.

This is like a machine that runs within your machine.

To use this you will need to install Vagrant from here: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

To get this started make sure that you have the `Vagrantfile` file in your current directory then run:

```
vagrant up
```

This will set up your machine and install everything, then you will be ready to get developing!
